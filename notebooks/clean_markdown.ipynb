He led England to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 1990. He left England to manage other football teams in Europe. These included clubs from The Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Robson came back to England to manage Newcastle United F.C. in 1999.\n",

He played for Albion for six years. During that time, he played in nearly 250 games, scoring over 50 goals. Albion said no when Robson asked for a bigger salary, and he moved back to Fulham. Fulham sold some important players after Robson came back to the team. This led Robson to think he would not win any trophies. He left Fulham in 1967 and joined the Vancouver Royals in Canada as both a player and a manager. However, he had to share the management role with someone else. Robson did not like this and moved back to England in 1968. He started to manage Fulham.\n",
