## Early life

Robson was born on 18 February 1933 in Sacriston, County Durham.  He was the fourth of five brothers.  As a young child he often went to St James' Park with his father to watch Newcastle United F.C.

When he was only 15, Robson played football in a local team of boys aged 18.  He became an apprentice electrician while still playing football.

## Playing career
### Club football
Robson played in his first professional football game for Fulham F.C. in 1950.  He spent six years at the club before moving to West Bromwich Albion for £25,000.  He played for Albion for six years. During that time, he played in nearly 250 games, scoring over 50 goals.  Albion said no when Robson asked for a bigger salary, and he moved back to Fulham.  Fulham sold some important players after Robson came back to the team.  This led Robson to think he would not win any trophies. He left Fulham in 1967 and joined the Vancouver Royals in Canada as both a player and a manager. However, he had to share the management role with someone else.  Robson did not like this and moved back to England in 1968.  He started to manage Fulham.
