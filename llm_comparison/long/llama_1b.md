== History ==

=== Early years (1878–1945) ===
Manchester United was started in 1878. It was called Newton Heath LYR Football Club. The Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot started the club at Newton Heath. All of the team worked at Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot. The team first played against other departments and against other railway companies. On 20 November 1880, it played in their first official match. The players wore the colours of the railway company: green and gold. They lost 6–0 against the reserve team of Bolton Wanderers. In 1888, the club became a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. The league stopped after only one year. Newton Heath joined the new Football Alliance. This ran for three seasons. It was then combined with The Football League. This meant the club started the 1892–93 season in the First Division. By this time it was not a part of the railway company. It did not use "LYR" in its name anymore. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

In January 1902 the club had debts of £2,670, equivalent to (the same as) £ in. The club got a winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies who became club president. Each businessman invested £500. They were then allowed to help run the club. On 24 April 1902, they changed the name of the club to Manchester United F.C.. Ernest Mangnall became the manager in 1903. The team finished the Second Division in second position in 1906. It went back to the First Division. It won the league in 1908. This was the club's first league title. The season after, the club won the first ever Charity Shield. That season, the club also won its first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911. At the end of the next season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.

In 1922, three years after football started again after the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division. It stayed in this division until

Newton Heath first played on a field on North Road. This was close to the railway. At first, the capacity (number of people who could watch) was about 12,000. However, club officials said the facilities were not good enough for a club that wanted to join The Football League. They made it bigger in 1887. In 1891, Newton Heath bought two grandstands. Each held 1,000 people. Attendances (the number of people watching) were not recorded for many of the early matches at North Road. However, the highest attendance was about 15,000. This was for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893. There was a similar attendance for a friendly match (not competitive) against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.

Manchester United won its first league title in 1908. It won the FA Cup a year later. Davies decided that that Bank Street was too small for his ambitions. In February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford became the home of Manchester United. The club bought the land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch had about £30,000 to build the stadium. The original plans were for a capacity of 100,000 people. However, this changed to 77,000 because it was too expensive. Brameld and Smith of Manchester built the stadium. The stadium's record attendance was on 25 March 1939. It was for an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town. 76

Manchester United has been called a global brand. In 2011, Brand Finance said the club's trademarks and intellectual property was worth £412 million. This was £39 million more than the year before. It was also £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid. It gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely (very) Strong). In July 2012, Forbes magazine placed Manchester United first in its list of the ten most valuable (worth the most money) sports team brands. It said that the Manchester United brand was worth $2.23 billion. The club is third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion. Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion. This was $1.2 billion more than the next most valuable sports team. Real Madrid were first for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017. It had a valuation of $3.689 billion.

Many say that the strength of Manchester United's global brand is thanks to Matt Busby. He built the team again after the Munich air disaster. Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (both won the World Cup with England in 1966), Denis Law and George Best played in this team. The team had an attacking style of play and "captured the imagination of the English footballing public". Busby's team also became linked to the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s. George Best was known as the "Fifth Beatle" because of his haircut. He was the first footballer to be important in the media away from football.

Manchester United was the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. The club had a lot of money after this. This helped with its commercial strategy. The club focused on both commercial and sporting success. This brought high profits whereas the football industry often brings large losses. The Manchester United brand became stronger because the media were very interested in player's personal lives. The most famous example is David Beckham (who also made his own global brand). This attention often makes people more interested in the football. This gives the club more chances for sponsorship, which becomes more valuable when it is on television often. During his time with the club, Beckham became more popular across Asia. This was very important for the club's commercial success in that part of the world.

When a club finishes in a better position in the league it gets more money from television rights. This means that if a team wins more matches, the club also gets more money. Since the Premier League started, Manchester United has had the most revenue from the BSkyB television rights. Manchester United has also had the highest commercial income of any English club. In 2005–06, the club's commercial operation made £51 million. This was £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. An important sponsorship relationship was with sports company Nike. They looked after the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. There are many branded products and services to buy through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme. There are also Manchester United-branded media services. For example, the club has its own television channel, MUTV. This has helped the club get more fans who aren't able to got to Old Trafford.

Sharp Electronics was the club's first shirt sponsor. They first signed a five-year deal worth £500,000. This was at the beginning of the 1982–83 season. This relationship lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season. In 2000, Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal. Vodafone then agreed to pay £36 million to make the deal four years longer. However, after two seasons it stopped being the sponsor to focus on its sponsorship of the Champions League.

For the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG was the shirt sponsor. They signed a four-year £56.5 million deal. In September 2006, it was the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in the world. In 2010, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's shirt sponsor. They signed a four-year deal worth about £80 million. It became the most expensive shirt sponsorship deal in football history. In August 2011, Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor. They agreed a four-year deal with DHL. Reports say it was worth £40 million. Reports also say it was the first training kit sponsorship deal in English football. The DHL contract lasted for just over a year. The club cancelled the contract in October 2012. DHL stayed the club's official logistics partner. United then sold the contract for the training kit sponsorship to Aon in April 2013. The deal was worth £180 million over eight years. This was also for the naming rights (Aon were allowed to use their name) for the Trafford Training Centre (also called Carrington).

The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro. In 1975, United agreed a five-year deal with Admiral Sportswear. Adidas received the new contract in 1980. Umbro became the manufacturer again in 1992. Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years. After this, Nike signed a record £302.9 million deal. This that lasted until 2015. The club sold 3.8 million replica shirts in the first 22 months with the company. The club also had other sponsors such as Aon and Budweiser.

On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors. They became the shirt sponsor after Aon, from the 2014–15 season. The deal was worth about $80m-a-year or $559m over seven years. The club used the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet on the shirts. Nike said that they would not sign a new kit deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season. They said this was because it was becoming more expensive. In 2015, Adidas became the new kit sponsor for Manchester United. They signed a world-record 10-year deal worth at least £750 million. Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor at the start of the 2018–19 season. The deal with General Motors ended in 2021. Manchester United then signed a five-year deal with TeamViewer. The deal is worth £235m.

Ownership and finances

### Transformed text

## The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company first funded the club.

The club became a limited company in 1892. It sold shares to its supporters for £1. It used an application form. In 1902, the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy became the main owners. John Henry Davies was among these. He became the club president. After his death in 1927, the club was at risk of bankruptcy again. James W. Gibson saved it in December 1931. He took control of the club after investing £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948. James Gibson died three years later. The Gibson family stayed as the owner of the club through James' wife, Lillian. However, the former player Harold Hardman became the chairman.

Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, became part of the board a few days after the Munich air disaster. He started to buy shares in the club. He spent about £40,000. He had a 54 percent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, Alan Gibson got her shares. He sold some of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978. Martin Edwards became chairman when his father died in 1980. Media tycoon Robert Maxwell tried to buy the club in 1984. However, he did not want to pay the price Edward wanted. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards tried to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20 million. The sale did not happen. Knighton joined the board of directors instead.

Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million). Another businessman wanted to buy them in 1998. This time it was Rupert Murdoch and his British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. As a result Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – encouraged fans to buy shares in the club to stop any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer. However, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission stopped the deal at the last stage in April 1999. A few years later, there was a power struggle (different people wanted control) at the club. The club manager, Alex Ferguson disagreed with his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus. They had slowly become the largest shareholders. They had an argument about who owned the horse Rock of Gibraltar. Magnier and McManus didn't want Ferguson to be manager anymore. The board then looked for new investors to try to make the Irishmen's majority smaller.

In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer bought the 28.7 percent stake from McManus and Magnier. This meant he had a controlling interest through his company Red Football Ltd. He borrowed a lot of money to buy the club and become the owner. The club's value was about £800 million (at the time about $1.5 billion). After this, the club was not on the stock exchange anymore. In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package (deal). This meant there was 30 percent less interest to pay every year. It was then about £62 million a year. In January 2010, the club had debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion). Manchester United refinanced more through a bond issue worth £504 million. This meant the club could pay most of the £509 million it owed to international banks. The club had to pay interest of about £45 million per year on the bonds.  The bonds were to mature on 1 February 2017. The club's debt made fans angry. They staged a protest on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and at the club's Trafford Training Centre. Supporter groups told fans who went to the match to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports said that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of rich fans. These fans were nicknamed the "Red Knights". They had plans to buy the club from the Glazers.

In August 2011, reports said the Glazers went to Credit Suisse to start a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange. This meant the value of the club would be more than £2 billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. The share price was going to be between $16 and $20 each. The price fell to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August. This was because of bad comments from Wall Street analysts. It was also because Facebook had a bad start on the stock market in May 2012. Even with the lower share price, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion. This made it most valuable football club in the world.

There are two different types of shares for the club. The people who own the shares have different voting rights (to make decisions) at the club. The public have "Class A" share. These shares have 10 times lesser voting rights than the Glazers own. Those shares are called "Class B" shares. At the start in 2012, the public could only buy 10% of the shares. As of 2019, the Glazers still had control over the club. They had over 70% of shares. They had even higher voting power.

In 2012, The Guardian estimated that the club had paid over £500 million in debt interest and other fees for the Glazers. In 2019, The Guardian reported that this sum was now £1 billion. At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly £400 million.

In 2023, the Glazers were interested in selling some shares. Different investors were interested. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns INEOS, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, both said they were interested in investing in the club. In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also said he was interested.

On 24 December 2023, the club said that Ratcliffe had bought 25 per cent of Manchester United. It also said that his INEOS Sport company was going to look after football operations. The Glazers are still the biggest shareholders. They own over 40% of the shares. Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed the deal to buy shares in the club on 21 February 2024. As of 2024, he owns 27.7% of the club (25% of the Class A shares and 25% of the Class B shares).

Manchester United has won more trophies than most clubs in Europe. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup. It won this as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won its first league title. It won the FA Cup for the first time the year after. Since then, it has won a record 20 first division titles. This includes a record 13 Premier League titles. Its 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). They have also played a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (which used to be called the FA Charity Shield). This is a game at the start of each season between the winners of the league and the FA Cup from the season before. Out of those 30 games, Manchester United won 21. This counts four times when the match was a draw and the two clubs shared the trophy.

The club won a lot under manager Matt Busby. This started with the FA Cup in 1948. The high point was becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, and winning five league titles in the years before. However, the club's best decade was in the 1990s when Alex Ferguson was the manager. In the 1990s, he helped the club win five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club also won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times during the 1990s. Before their first double in 1993–94, it had only happened five times in English football. When they won a second double in 1995–96, it was called the "Double Double". They were the first team to win the double twice. They won the European Cup (now the UEFA Champions League) for a second time in 1999, and the Premier League and FA Cup. This means they became the first English club to win the Treble. That Champions League title meant they could play in the Intercontinental Cup (which doesn't exist anymore). They also won this cup. They are the only British team to win the Intercontinental Cup. They won another Champions League title in 2008. This meant they qualified for the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. They also won this cup. Until 2019, they were the only British team to win that competition. Liverpool then won it in 2019.

The club's won the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17. By winning that title, United became the fifth club to win the "European Treble" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.

The club's won its 2022–23 EFL Cup in February 2023. Its most recent trophy is the FA Cup. The club won 2–1 against Manchester City on 25 May 2024.
