**Manchester United F.C.**

Manchester United Football Club (F.C.) is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. It plays in the Premier League, the highest level of English football, and its nickname is "the Red Devils". The club started as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changing its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moving to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.

Manchester United has won more trophies than any other club in English football (other than Liverpool FC). It has won 20 League titles, 13 FA Cups, six League Cups, and 21 FA Community Shields. United has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup, and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998-99, the club became the first in the history of English football to win the continental European treble. It won the UEFA Europa League in 2016-17 and became one of five clubs to win all three top UEFA club competitions.

Matt Busby led the club to lots of success by using youth players until the Munich air disaster in 1958. The Munich air disaster is a famous plane crash in the club's history, resulting in the deaths of eight Manchester United players and other staff. In 1968, manager Matt Busby guided Manchester United to the European Cup, becoming the first English football club to win this trophy.

Sir Alex Ferguson is one of the most famous managers of the club, winning 38 trophies as manager. This includes 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013. He retired in 2013.

Manchester United was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. Malcolm Glazer bought the club in May 2005, valuing it at almost £800 million. It went public again in August 2012 with an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Manchester United was the highest-earning football club in the world in 2016-17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million, and the most valuable football club in the world in 2024, with a value of £4.96 billion ($6.2 billion). As of June 2015, it is also the world's most valuable football brand, with an estimated value of $1.2 billion. Manchester United has the most fans in the world and has big rivalries with Liverpool F.C., Manchester City, Arsenal, and Leeds United.

**History**

**Early years (1878–1945)**

Manchester United was started in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. All of the team worked at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot. The team first played against other departments and against other railway companies. On 20 November 1880, it played in their first official match against the reserve team of Bolton Wanderers, losing 6–0. The players wore the colours of the railway company: green and gold. In 1888, the club became a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league, which stopped after only one year. Newton Heath then joined the new Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being combined with The Football League. This meant the club started the 1892-93 season in the First Division. By this time, it was no longer part of the railway company and did not use "LYR" in its name anymore. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

In January 1902, the club had debts of £2,670 and got a winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies who became club president, each investing £500 to help run the club. On 24 April 1902, they changed the name of the club to Manchester United F.C. Ernest Mangnall became the manager in 1903. The team finished the Second Division in second position in 1906, going back to the First Division. It won the league in 1908, its first league title, and the season after won the first ever Charity Shield and its first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911. At the end of the next season, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.

In 1922, three years after football started again after the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division. It stayed in this division until 1925, going back to the first division, but was relegated again in 1931. Manchester United became a yo-yo club. In 1934, it had its worst ever position in the league, 20th place in the Second Division. The main benefactor, John Henry Davies, died in October 1927, and after this the club's finances got worse. Manchester United were close to bankruptcy, but James W. Gibson invested £2,000 in December 1931, taking control of the club. In the 1938-39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club was 14th in the First Division.

**Busby years (1945–1969)**

In October 1945, football started again, and Matt Busby became the manager. He wanted a lot of control when choosing players, player transfers, and training sessions. Busby and his team finished second in 1947, 1948, and 1949, winning the FA Cup in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, the first time it won the league for 41 years, and also won league titles in 1956 and 1957. Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful. At that time, the team had an average age of 22, and the media gave them the nickname "the Busby Babes" because Busby believed in his young players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to play in the European Cup. The Football League did not want the club to play, but it did not stop them. The year before, the Football League had stopped Chelsea from playing in that cup. United lost in the semi-final to Real Madrid. However, earlier in the tournament, the team won a 10–0 victory against Belgian champions Anderlecht, still the club's biggest ever victory.

The season after, the Munich air disaster happened. It was after the club won against Red Star Belgrade in the European Cup quarter-final. The plane carrying the Manchester United players, officials, and journalists crashed while trying to take off after it stopped for fuel in Munich, Germany, on 6 February 1958. 23 people died in the Munich air disaster, including eight players: Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor, and Billy Whelan. The crash also injured many other people.

The assistant manager, Jimmy Murphy, became the manager while Busby recovered from his injuries. The club still got to the FA Cup final, but it lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to play in the 1958-59 European Cup. The Football Association agreed, but the Football League said that the club should not enter the competition because it had not qualified.

Busby built the team again in the 1960s. He signed players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who played well with the next generation of young players, including George Best. The club won the FA Cup in 1963. The season after, it finished second in the league. It won the league in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British, after Celtic F.C.) club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final. The team had three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, and George Best. The club then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina. It lost the first match in Buenos Aires, 1–0, and drew 1–1 at Old Trafford three weeks later, losing the cup. Busby resigned as manager in 1969. The reserve team coach replaced him; he was former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.

**1969–1986**

The club finished in 8th place in the 1969-70 season. It had a bad start to the 1970-71 season, and Busby started to be the temporary manager again. McGuinness went back to being the reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell became the manager. He stayed less than 18 months. Tommy Docherty became the new manager in December 1972. Docherty helped Manchester United stay in the First Division that season. However, the club was relegated to the second division in 1974. Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club by that point. The team won promotion back to the first division the year after. United played in the FA Cup final in 1976, but Southampton won the match. The club was in the final again in 1977 and beat Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was sacked soon after because he had had an affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.

Dave Sexton became the new manager in the summer of 1977. He signed the famous players Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins. However, the team did not have great results. It finished in the top two in 1979-80 but lost against Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final. Sexton was sacked in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games when he was the manager. Ron Atkinson replaced him. He broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985. In 1985-86, the club was favourite to win the league after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches. However, they only finished the season in fourth place. Atkinson was sacked the year after because the club was already in danger of relegation by November.

**Ferguson years (1986–2013)**

# Alex Ferguson's Era at Manchester United

Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's left. They guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. They finished second in 1987-88, but the club was back in 11th place the season after. Reports say Ferguson almost lost his job. A win against Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3-3 draw) saved Ferguson's career. The season after this, Manchester United won its first Cup Winners' Cup title. It also played in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup. It beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1-0 in the final at Old Trafford. In 1992, United played in another League Cup final. The club beat Nottingham Forest 1-0 at Wembley. In 1993, Manchester United won its first league title since 1967. A year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second title in a row. It also won the FA Cup. This means the team completed the first "Double" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to win the Double twice. It won both competitions again in 1995-96. In 1996-97, it won the league again, one game before the end of the season.

In the 1998-99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – "The Treble" – in the same season. The team was losing 1-0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final. Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory against Bayern Munich. It is remembered as one of the greatest comebacks of all time. The club also won the Intercontinental Cup. It beat Palmeiras 1-0 in Tokyo. Ferguson was then knighted for his services to football. He became Sir Alex Ferguson.

Manchester United won the league again in the 1999-2000 and 2000-01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001-02. It won the title again in 2002-03. It won the 2003-04 FA Cup. United beat Millwall 3-0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. It won the trophy for a record 11th time. In the 2005-06 season, Manchester United did not play in the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League. This was the first time in over ten years. The club still managed to finish second in the league. It also won the 2006 Football League Cup Final against Wigan Athletic. The club won the Premier League again in the 2006-07 season. In 2007-08, it won the European double. United won a penalty shootout 6-5 against Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow and won its 17th English league title. In that season, Ryan Giggs played a record 759th game for the club. This was more than the old record of Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup. It then won the 2008-09 Football League Cup. Later that year, United won a third Premier League title in a row. In the summer of 2009, United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United beat Aston Villa 2-1 at Wembley to win the League Cup again. This was the first time it defended a knockout cup competition.

The club finished second behind Chelsea in the 2009-10 season. In 2010-11, United won a record 19th league title. It won the league with a 1-1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. It made this 20 league titles in 2012-13. It won the league with a 3-0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.

## Recent history

### 2013 - Present

On 8 May 2013, Ferguson said he would retire as manager at the end of the football season. He said he would stay at the club as a director and club ambassador. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would be the new manager from 1 July. He signed a six-year contract. Moyes was sacked after a bad season. The club finished 7th in the Premier League title. It did not qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995-96. The club also did not qualify for the Europa League. This was the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990. Ryan Giggs became player-manager on 22 April 2014, only 10 months after Moyes became manager. On 19 May 2014, the club said Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager. He got a three-year deal. Giggs was his assistant. Malcolm Glazer, of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.

In Van Gaal's first season, United finished in fourth in the Premier League. This meant they reached the Champions League. In Van Gaal's second season, United lost in the group stage of this tournament. United bought a few expensive players. In 2015, after winning 3-0 against Sunderland, Man United reached 1st place for the first time in over two years. However, after losing 0-3 to Arsenal, the club fell to 3rd place. The team did not do very well in the league. They finished in 5th place. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time. This was their first trophy since 2013. Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later.

José Mourinho became the new manager on 27 May 2016. He signed a three-year contract. That season, United finished in sixth place in the league. They won the EFL Cup for the fifth time and the Europa League for the first time. They also won the FA Community Shield for a record 21st time. This was Mourinho's first competitive match as the manager. United did not finish in the top four, but qualified for the Champions League because they won the Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal with United. He passed Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer. Rooney left the club at the end of the season. He went back to Everton. On 18 December 2018, Mourinho was sacked by the club after 144 games as the manager. United were in sixth place in the Premier League table. They were 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places. The day after, former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær became the caretaker manager until the end of the season.

On 28 March 2019, Solskjær became the permanent manager on a three-year deal. Until then, he had 14 wins from his first 19 matches as manager. In this time, his team beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in the Champions League after losing the first match 2-0. In the 2019-2020 season, Manchester United reached three semi-finals. They played in the semi-final of the League Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa league. They lost all three matches. This is the first time an English team has lost three cup semi-finals in the same season. Manchester United finished third in the Premier League. They beat Leicester City 2-0 in the last match of the season to stay above Chelsea who finished fourth. In January, the club signed midfield player Bruno Fernandes. He came from Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon, like Cristiano Ronaldo 16 years before. The British media said that Fernandes was one of the main reasons the club finished in the top 4. Manchester United did not lose in the Premier league for the rest of the season, after Fernandes joined (9 wins, 5 draws).

On 18 April 2021, Manchester United said it was joining 11 other European clubs to make a European Super League (ESL). This was going to be a 20-team competition to rival the UEFA Champions League. Many fans, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government were very unhappy. The club changed its plans just two days later. The executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward resigned from his job. After the ESL plan, there were protests against Woodward and the Glazer family. There was a pitch invasion before a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021. This was the first time a match was moved in the Premier League game due to fan protests.

That year, the club matched its record for the biggest win in the Premier League. It won 9-0 against Southampton on 2 February 2021. It lost the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, on penalties. This was the fourth year without winning a trophy. On 20 November 2021, Solskjær left the club. Former midfielder Michael Carrick became the temporary manager for three games. After this, Ralf Rangnick became the temporary manager until the end of that season.

On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag became the manager from the end of the 2021-22 season. He signed a contract until June 2025 with the option of one more year. Manchester United won 2-0 in the 2022-23 EFL Cup final against Newcastle United. On 5 March 2023, the club had its biggest defeat. It lost 7-0 against Liverpool at Anfield.

In 2023-2024, Manchester United had a difficult season. The club only finished 8th in the Premier League. This was its lowest finish in the League since 1989-1990. However, the club won its 13th FA Cup against rivals Manchester City, at Wembley on 25 May 2024. The final finished 2-1 to United. Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo both scored in the first half. Jeremy Doku scored late in the second half for Man City. This was Ten Hag's second trophy in two seasons.

# Crest and colours

**Crest and Kit History**

The club crest originates from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, but only the ship in full sail remains on the current crest. The devil comes from the club's nickname "The Red Devils". Club programmes and scarves in the 1960s featured a devil, which became part of the club crest in 1970. The club added the crest to the front of the shirt in 1971.

*1879*: Newton Heath's uniform was documented as 'white with blue cord', four years before their first match in a competition.

**Support**

Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe. The club has over 200 officially recognised Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC) groups in at least 24 countries. The club goes on summer tours every year, which are very popular. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte believe that Manchester United has 75 million fans in the world. The club has the third most people in the world following them on social media among sports teams, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid. As of December 2019, the club has over 73 million Facebook fans. A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.

Two independent bodies help the fans: the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA) and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family bought the club in 2005, a group of fans formed another club called F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford is called the "Stretford End", which is the home end (where the local fans sit) and the loudest part of the stadium.

**Rivalries**

*Manchester City*: Manchester United's main local rivals are Manchester City. The two clubs contest the Manchester Derby, one of the most anticipated matches in English football. The rivalry is fueled by their close proximity, contrasting histories, and the intense competition for local bragging rights.

*Liverpool*: Manchester United and Liverpool are two of the most successful clubs in English football history, with a rich rivalry that dates back to the 1960s. The intensity of the rivalry has been fueled by their competition for league titles and European cups, as well as their contrasting playing styles and fan bases.

**Rivalries**

Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal, Leeds United, Liverpool, and Manchester City. The club plays in the Manchester derby against Manchester City.

The rivalry with Liverpool comes from the competition between the two cities during the Industrial Revolution. At the time, Manchester was famous for its textile industry and Liverpool was an important port. The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic (in England) and international competitions. Between them they have won 39 league titles, 9 European Cups, 4 UEFA Cups, 5 UEFA Super Cups, 20 FA Cups, 14 League Cups, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup and 37 FA Community Shields. It is one of the biggest rivalries in the football world. It is also one of the most famous matches in English football.

The "Roses Rivalry" with Leeds comes from the Wars of the Roses. These were wars between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United part of Lancashire and Leeds part of Yorkshire.

The rivalry with Arsenal comes from the two teams, and managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, often fighting for the Premier League title. They have 33 league trophies between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal). This has become one of the biggest Premier League rivalries in history.

**Global brand**

Manchester United has been called a global brand. In 2011, Brand Finance said the club's trademarks and intellectual property was worth £412 million. This was £39 million more than the year before. It was also £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid. It gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely (very) Strong). In July 2012, Forbes magazine placed Manchester United first in its list of the ten most valuable (worth the most money) sports team brands. It said that the Manchester United brand was worth $2.23 billion. The club is third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion. Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion. This was $1.2 billion more than the next most valuable sports team. Real Madrid were first for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017. It had a valuation of $3.689 billion.

Many say that the strength of Manchester United's global brand is thanks to Matt Busby. He built the team again after the Munich air disaster. Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (both won the World Cup with England in 1966), Denis Law and George Best played in this team. The team had an attacking style of play and "captured the imagination of the English footballing public". Busby's team also became linked to the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s. George Best was known as the "Fifth Beatle" because of his haircut. He was the first footballer to be important in the media away from football.

Manchester United was the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. The club had a lot of money after this. This helped with its commercial strategy. The club focused on both commercial and sporting success. This brought high profits whereas the football industry often brings large losses. The Manchester United brand became stronger because the media were very interested in player's personal lives. The most famous example is David Beckham (who also made his own global brand). This attention often makes people more interested in the football. This gives the club more chances for sponsorship, which becomes more valuable when it is on television often. During his time with the club, Beckham became more popular across Asia. This was very important for the club's commercial success in that part of the world.

When a club finishes in a better position in the league it gets more money from television rights. This means that if a teams wins more matches, the club also gets more money. Since the Premier League started, Manchester United has had the the most revenue from the BSkyB television rights. Manchester United has also had the highest commercial income of any English club. In 2005–06, the club's commercial operation made £51 million. This was £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. An important sponsorship relationship was with sports company Nike. They looked after the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. There are many branded products and services to buy through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme. There are also Manchester United-branded media services. For example, the club has its own television channel, MUTV. This has helped the club get more fans who aren't able to got to Old Trafford.

Sharp Electronics was the club's first shirt sponsor. They first signed a five-year deal worth £500,000. This was at the beginning of the 1982–83 season. This relationship lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season. In 2000, Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal. Vodafone then agreed to pay £36 million to make the deal four years longer. However, after two seasons it stopped being the sponsor to focus on its sponsorship of the Champions League.

For the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG was the shirt sponsor. They signed a four-year £56.5 million deal. In September 2006, it was the biggest shirt sponsorship deal in the world. In 2010, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's shirt sponsor. They signed a four-year deal worth about £80 million. It became the most expensive shirt sponsorship deal in football history. In August 2011, Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor. They agreed a four-year deal with DHL. Reports say it was worth £40 million. Reports also say it was the first training kit sponsorship deal in English football. The DHL contract lasted for just over a year. The club cancelled the contract in October 2012. DHL stayed the club's official logistics partner. United then sold the contract for the training kit sponsorship to Aon in April 2013. The deal was worth £180 million over eight years. This was also for the naming rights (Aon were allowed to use their name) for the Trafford Training Centre (also called Carrington).

The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro. In 1975, United agreed a five-year deal with Admiral Sportswear. Adidas received the new contract in 1980. Umbro became the manufacturer again in 1992. Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years. After this, Nike signed a record £302.9 million deal. This lasted until 2015. The club sold 3.8 million replica shirts in the first 22 months with the company. The club also had other sponsors such as Aon and Budweiser.

On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors. They became the shirt sponsor after Aon, from the 2014–15 season. The deal was worth about $80m-a-year or $559m over seven years. The club used the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet on the shirts. Nike said that they would not sign a new kit deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season. They said this was because it was becoming more expensive. In 2015, Adidas became the new kit sponsor for Manchester United. They signed a world-record 10-year deal worth at least £750 million. Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor at the start of the 2018–19 season. The deal with General Motors ended in 2021. Manchester United then signed a five-year deal with TeamViewer. The deal is worth £235m.

## Manchester United Women
- A team called Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies started in the late 1970s. It was unofficially recognised as the club's women's team. It helped start the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989. The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001. It became the club's official women's team. However, in 2005, after Malcolm Glazer became the owner, the club was disbanded. This was because it was seen to be "unprofitable" (not good for making money). In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team. It started in the second division of women's football in England in its first season. It won the championship that season. The season after, it joined the first division, the Women's Super League.
